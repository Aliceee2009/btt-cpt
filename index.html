        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a ninth-grade student who is attending St. Edmund Campion Secondary School. Throughout my participation in this business course, I've learned how to incorporate data into spreadsheets, how to write a straightforward business letter using the block letter format, how to incorporate information in a presentation using various presentation softwares (ex. Canva, Google Slides, PowerPoint), and the names of basic computer components in modern day society. Even though I'm only fourteen years old, my knowledge has already expanded greatly, and I still have a lot of time to learn and gain new abilities.
